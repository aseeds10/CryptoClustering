# Project Title
Predicting CryptoCurrency Price Changes (Unsupervised Machine Learning)

## Description
Using Python and unsupervised learning tools to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. This also includes an exploration on comparing methods such as: 
scaling and using all features in the datset for the model **VS** utilizing PCA to focus the model on the chosen number of features that explain a certain percentage of the variance.
<br>
<br>**NOTE:** I am using sample/example data, not real crypto data.</br>

## Installation
1. pandas library (including hvplot)
2. sklearn (including KMeans, PCA, and StandardScaler)

## Acknowledgments
- Used Xpert Learning Assistant for assistance with debugging as necessary.
- Used holoviz documentation for reference on composing plots (https://holoviz.org/tutorial/Composing_Plots.html).
